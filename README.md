# TestingFundamentalsProject_1
 
4 Pages for Testing: Home page, Login page (actually sitatued visible for all pages at the left menu but we onsider it as a separate page, because when playing with login fields the page results are coming at the right side and link of webpage changes), Contact page (for customer care) Admin page (Administrative work)

Used 3 additional overriden functions from EventReporter that implements the WebDriverEventListener, overriden functions are used on all pages whie editing and clicking elements

Screenshots' functiontionality implemented and kept in src/test/screenshots folder

Additionally added the testng.xml file for parallel testing of all classes.

Note that there are 2 Tests that are disabled in order not to spam or overload the memory, you may set (enabled = true)
